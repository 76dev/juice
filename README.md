# Structure

## Hero

**Juice** is designed for product websites, hence we let **hero** part fills whole of screen.
You can customize your **hero** by using `hero` block in the `index.html`.

```html
{% block hero %}
    <div>
        Your cool hero html...
    </div>
{% endblock hero %}
```

## Page

Every markdown file located in `content` directory will become a **Page**. There also will display as
a navigate link on the top-right corner. 
You can change the frontmatter's `weight` value to sort the order (ascending order).

```
+++
title = "Changelog"
description = "Changelog"
weight = 3
+++

```

## External nav links

If you need add external navigate links, you should customize the `render_header` macro. 
Just like this:

```html
<nav>
    {% for page in section.pages %}
    <a class="nav-item subtitle-text" href="{{ page.permalink }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
    {% endfor %}
    <a class="nav-item subtitle-text" href="https://github.com/huhu/juice">Github</a>
</nav>
```
